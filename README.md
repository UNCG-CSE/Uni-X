  Analyzing repayment rate for college score data .
### SHORT DESCRIPTION
  Repayment provides a sense for the debt burden of attending college and the loan performance metrics for each school. It can provide useful information for students and families who concerned about borrowing for college, and for the federal government interested in seeing borrowersâ€™ behavior after they leave the school.
