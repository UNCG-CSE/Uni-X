Target goals:
List of overall goals you are trying to achieve in the project, and the tasks assigned to you:
overall goals:
1. What variables can affect repayment rate?
2. Estimate repayment rate base on other variables.
3. Predict repayment rate in coming years. 

short term goals by date:
*merge data
*clean data
*descriptive analysis

Tasks assign to member:
In order to get familar with the dataset and tool, all of us works on the similar thing in the stage of preparing data and descriptive analysis. We would assign the different goals for different member soon.

Achieved goals / activities:

Ahlam:
List the activities by date and how that relates to the goal:
1- I just select a specific columns that relate to repayment rate, and then we can figure it out which catagories of theses columns we will work with
2- Adding project goal and image in readme, and updated team members.
3- adding mode () function code to see the frequent variables in the repayment cols
4- using sharable function for downlouding the cmprehnisive csv file with cleaned data and getting the mean for each row
Amount of time spent per each of the activities:
1- 3 hours
2- half hour
3- half hour
4- one hour

Bin:
List the activities by date and how that relates to the goal:

1-Select valid explanatory variable(exclude any variable on repayment rate) and response variable(repayment rate by years) based on dictionry
2-Explore valid observation for different types of repayment rate
3-Merge and clean data and export to .csv file
4-Develop sharable function for the whole data management process 
5-Start descriptive analysis on repayment rate: draw histogram and compute correlation between y and x variables.


Amount of time spent per each of the activities:
1 - 2 hour
